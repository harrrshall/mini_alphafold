# Mini AlphaFold: A Toy Model for Protein Folding

This repository contains a simplified implementation of AlphaFold, along with a toy dataset, for educational purposes.  It allows users to experiment with protein folding concepts and simplified machine learning models.

## Dataset Generation and Preprocessing

The dataset is generated and preprocessed using the following scripts:

* **`minifold_dataset.py`**:  Generates a toy protein dataset with a reduced amino acid alphabet and a simplified energy function. The generated data is split into train, validation, and test sets and saved in the `protein_dataset` directory.
* **`preprocess_dataset.py`**: Preprocesses the generated dataset for use in machine learning models. This involves padding, relative position encoding, normalization, and caching. The preprocessed data is saved in the `preprocessed_protein_dataset` directory.

Refer to the detailed documentation in the previous response for more information on the dataset generation and preprocessing steps.

## Usage Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the provided scripts to generate, preprocess, and load the dataset for training or inference.

### 1. Setting up the Environment

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Markdown

Activate the virtual environment:

source venv/bin/activate
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash

Install the required packages (ensure you have a requirements.txt file listing the dependencies like NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, tqdm, and PyTorch):

pip install -r requirements.txt
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash
2. Generating the Dataset

Run the following command to generate the toy protein dataset:

python minifold_dataset.py
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash

This will create the protein_dataset directory containing the train, validation, and test sets in JSON and pickle format. It also generates usage_example.py inside the protein_dataset directory.

3. Preprocessing the Dataset

Run the following command to preprocess the generated data:

python preprocess_dataset.py
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash

This will create the preprocessed_protein_dataset directory containing the preprocessed train, validation, and test sets. Each protein is saved as a separate .pt file (PyTorch tensor). Dataset statistics are also saved in this directory.

4. Loading and Using the Dataset

The following code snippet demonstrates how to load and use the preprocessed dataset in PyTorch:

import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from preprocessed_protein_dataset import PreprocessedProteinDataset

# Load the preprocessed datasets
train_dataset = PreprocessedProteinDataset.load('preprocessed_protein_dataset/train')
val_dataset = PreprocessedProteinDataset.load('preprocessed_protein_dataset/val')
test_dataset = PreprocessedProteinDataset.load('preprocessed_protein_dataset/test')

# Create DataLoaders
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)
test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)

# Iterate through the train loader (example)
for batch in train_loader:
    sequence = batch['sequence']  # Tensor of padded sequence indices
    coords = batch['coordinates'] # Tensor of 2D coordinates
    distance_matrix = batch['distance_matrix'] # Tensor of padded distance matrix
    position_encoding = batch['position_encoding'] # Tensor of padded position encoding
    energy = batch['energy']  # Tensor of protein energies
    length = batch['length'] # Original sequence lengths
    properties = batch['properties']  # Tensor of hydrophobic and charged ratios
    
    # Process the batch data (e.g., feed to your model)
    print(f"Sequence shape: {sequence.shape}")
    print(f"Coordinates shape: {coords.shape}")
    # ... process other features ...

## Work in Progress

This project is currently a work in progress. The core functionality for generating and preprocessing a toy protein dataset is complete. However, the machine learning model and training components are still under development.

### Roadmap

The next steps for this project include:

* **`mini_alphafold.py`**: Implement a simplified AlphaFold model architecture. This will involve defining the neural network layers and operations required to predict protein structures from the input features.  **(Empty file created)**
* **`train.py`**:  Develop a training script to train the `mini_alphafold.py` model using the preprocessed dataset. This script will handle training loops, loss calculation, optimization, and model checkpointing. **(Empty file created)**
* **`inference.py`**: Create an inference script to use the trained model for predicting the 3D structure of new protein sequences. This script will load a trained model, preprocess the input sequence, and generate the predicted structure. **(Empty file created)**
* **Model Refinement**: Explore and implement potential improvements to the simplified AlphaFold model, such as incorporating attention mechanisms or more advanced loss functions.
* **Dataset Expansion**: Consider expanding the complexity of the toy dataset by increasing the amino acid alphabet size or incorporating more realistic energy functions.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Define and implement appropriate evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of the protein folding model.


## Repository Structure

Now, you should create those three empty files (inference.py, mini_alphafold.py, train.py) in your project directory to reflect the roadmap outlined in the README. This makes the README accurate and sets up the project structure for the next development phases.Python

This tutorial provides a basic guide to using the scripts and data within this repository. You can adapt the code snippets and parameters to fit your specific experimental needs. Remember that this is a simplified implementation for educational purposes, and real-world protein folding is considerably more complex.
